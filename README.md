# SPSFarmReport

SPSFarmReport is a tool that can be used to gather topology-related details from SharePoint farms. This tool has been for close to a decade. It was first written for MOSS 2007, and we've had this script out of CodePlex for every subsequent release of SharePoint including 2010, 2013, and now 2016.

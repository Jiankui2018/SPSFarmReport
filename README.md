# SPSFarmReport

SPSFarmReport is a tool that can be used to gather topology-related details from SharePoint farms. This tool has been for close to a decade. It was first written for MOSS 2007, and we've had this script out of CodePlex for every subsequent release of SharePoint including 2010, 2013, and now 2016!

Roughly, we gather and build a report on the below infra of your farm:
+ Farm General Settings
++ Central Admin URL
** Farm Build Version
** System Account
** Configuration Database details
* Services on Server
** MinROLE and its Compliance
* Distributed Caching
